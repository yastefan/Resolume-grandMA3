# Resolume-grandMA3

Resolume plugin to control grandMA3 from resolume via osc

![example](example.png)

The plugin can be used to control five grandMA3 executors via Resolume. Of course, any number of executors can be controlled via multiple instances of the plugin. It is also possible to synchronize the speed (in bpm) of Resolume with the speed of a speed fader in grandMA3.

As an additional feature, the button hits can be delayed so that they are only sent on the next first beat (on the bar). This allows you to create phasers in grandMA3 that are synchronized with the speed of Resolume and sent in phase (trigger comes on the kick).
